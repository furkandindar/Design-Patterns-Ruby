Design Patterns used: Template, Strategy, Observer Patterns

1- Gladiator's ability distribution is in Gladiator.rb. Before creating, first it checks if the sum of the abilities are more than 20, if not it allows to choose a weapon.

2- Weapons are increasing abilities (int,str,spd)

3- for fight test, if gladiator's strength is higher than monster's strength it allows you to choose numbers 1 or 2 (meaning you have %50 of success rate), if you are correct you will damage him, otherwise he will damage you. If gladiator's strength is lower than monster's strength it allows you to choose numbers between 1-3 (meaning you are weaker than the monster, so that you have %33 of chance and he has %66).

4- for question test, if gladiator's intelligence is more than 5(it's 8 in superhero arena), it will ask you harder questions, if not it will ask you easier questions.

5- for speed test, gladiator's speed is given in terms of second. You should write the string that is already defined.
